\description{
Hurricanes is a web-scraping library for R designed to deliver
hurricane data (past and current) into well-organized datasets. With these
datasets you can explore past hurricane tracks, forecasts and structure
elements.

Text products (Forecast/Advisory, Public Advisory, Discussions and
Probabilities) are only available from 1998 to current. An effort will be
made to add prior data as available.
