\description{
Parse wind radius data from product, if exists. This is somewhat tricky as the
  wind fields are 64KT, 50KT and 34KT and are listed in descending order. So,
  the first line will not always be 64KT, 50KT or even 34KT depending on
  strength of storm. What I do here is just extract the entire blob and work
  through it. I'll continue to look for ways to improve it.
