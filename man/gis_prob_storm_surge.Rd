\describe{
  \item{esurge}{The Tropical Cyclone Storm Surge Exceedances (P-Surge 2.5)
    data shows the probability, in percent, of a specified storm surge,
    including tides, exceeding the specified height, in feet, during the
    forecast period indicated. The 10 percent exceedance height, for example,
    is the storm surge height, including tides, above ground level (AGL) such
    that there is a 10 percent chance of exceeding it. The product is based
    upon an ensemble of Sea, Lake,and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH)
    model runs using the National Hurricane Center (NHC) official advisory
    and accounts for track, size, and intensity errors based on historical
    errors and astronomical tide. Valid values are 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50.}
  \item{psurge}{The Tropical Cyclone Storm Surge Probabilities (P-Surge 2.5)
    data shows the probability, in percent, of a specified storm surge
    occurring during the forecast period indicated. The product is based upon
    an ensemble of Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH)
    model runs using the National Hurricane Center(NHC) official advisory
    and accounts for track, size, and intensity errors based on historical
    errors and astronomical tide. Valid values are 0:20.}
