\details{
\code{get_storm_data} is a wrapper function to make it more
convenient to access the various storm products.

Types of products:
\describe{
  \item{discus}{Storm Discussions. This is technical information on the
    cyclone such as satellite presentation, forecast model evaluation, etc.}
  \item{fstadv}{Forecast/Advisory. These products contain the meat of an
    advisory package. Current storm information is available as well as
    structural design and forecast data.}
  \item{posest}{Position Estimate. Issued generally when a storm is
    threatening; provides a brief update on location and winds.}
  \item{public}{Public Advisory. Issued for public knowledge; more often for
    Atlantic than East Pacific storms. Contains general information.}
  \item{prblty}{Strike Probability. Discontinued after the 2005 hurricane
    season, strike probabilities list the chances of x-force winds in a
    particular city.}
  \item{update}{Cyclone Update. Generally issued when a significant change
    occurs in the cyclone.}
  \item{windprb}{Wind Probability. Replace strike probabilities beginning in
    the 2006 season. Nearly identical.}
