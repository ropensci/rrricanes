}
\details{
\code{get_storm_data} is a wrapper function to make it more
  convenient to access the various storm products.

Types of products:
\describe{
  \item{discus}{Storm Discussions. This is technical information on the
  cyclone such as satellite presentation, forecast model evaluation, etc.}
  \item{fstadv}{Forecast/Advisory. These products contain the meat of an
  advisory package. Current storm information is available as well as
  structural design and forecast data.}
  \item{posest}{Position Estimate. Issued generally when a storm is
  threatening; provides a brief update on location and winds.}
  \item{public}{Public Advisory. Issued for public knowledge; more often for
  Atlantic than East Pacific storms. Contains general information.}
  \item{prblty}{Strike Probability. Discontinued after the 2005 hurricane
  season, strike probabilities list the chances of x-force winds in a
  particular city.}
  \item{update}{Cyclone Update. Generally issued when a significant change
  occurs in the cyclone.}
  \item{windprb}{Wind Probability. Replace strike probabilities beginning in
  the 2006 season. Nearly identical.}
}

Progress bars are displayed by default. These can be turned off by setting
the dplyr.show_progress to FALSE. Additionally, you can display messages for
each advisory being worked by setting the rrricanes.working_msg to TRUE.
