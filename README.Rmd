# rrricanes

`rrricanes` is a R library that extracts information from available archives on past and current tropical cyclones. Currently, archives date back to 1998. 

Data can be obtained for cyclones in the north Atlantic (considered the Atlantic Basin) and north-eastern Pacific (the East Pacific Basin from 140&deg;W and eastward, and Central Pacific Basin from 140&deg;W to 180&deg;W). 

## Getting Started

Please view the vignette 'Getting Started':

```r
vignette("getting-started", package = "rrricanes")
```

[Online documentation](https://timtrice.github.io/rrricanes/) is also available.

### Prerequisites

`rrricanes` requires an active internet connection as data is extracted from online sources.

Additionally, to use high resolution tracking maps you must install the `rnaturalearthhires` package:

```r
install.packages("rnaturalearthhires",
                 repos = "http://packages.ropensci.org",
                 type = "source")
```

### Installing

`rrricanes` is currently only available in GitHub. It can be installed using the `devtools` package:

```r
devtools::install_github("timtrice/rrricanes")
```
