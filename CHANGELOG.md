### Added
  - dplyr.progress_bar for all products

  - `tracking_chart()` for a base world plot. `al_tracking_chart()` for chart centered on Atlantic basin. `ep_tracking_chart()` for chart centered on northeast Pacific.
  - `load_storm_data()` helps get datasets that have already been scraped and processed. Designed to make it more efficient to get data faster.
  - `status_abbr_to_str` converts storm status abbreviations (i.e., TD, TS, HU) to string.
  - `saffir` returns Saffir-Simpson classification of tropical cyclones; abbreviated.
  - `twoal` and `twoep` for Atlantic and east Pacific tropical weather outlooks.
  - Added options `rrricanes.http_timeout` and `rrricanes.http_attempts` to give user more control over failures.

  - Fix call to `get_storm_data`. Issue similar to #67. (#68)
  - Fix call to `gis_wsp`. Call in `rvest::html_nodes` generated "xpath_attrib" error. Add test for `gis_wsp`. (#70)

### Security
  - NA
